- **Framework**: Flutter 3.10+ for web deployment

## üéØ Critical Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Visual Redesign (CRITICAL - Week 1-2)

## üöÄ Development Workflow

### Building & Deployment
```bash
# Local development
flutter run -d web-server --web-port 8080

# Production build for GitHub Pages
flutter build web --release --base-href="/CrystalGrimoireBeta2/"

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
cp -r build/web/* . && git add . && git commit -m "Deploy updates" && git push
```

### Testing Strategy
1. **Local Testing**: Test all features in debug mode
2. **Console Verification**: Ensure no 404 errors or animation issues
3. **Mobile Responsive**: Test on various screen sizes
4. **Payment Flow**: Thoroughly test marketplace transactions
5. **Performance**: Monitor for smooth animations and fast loading

## üìä User Experience Goals

### Current Issues to Address
- Logo needs to be more prominent and mystical
- Crystal of the Day lacks visual impact
- Crystal identification needs higher visibility
- Spiritual Journal underutilized (convert to marketplace)
- Quick Guide isolated (integrate into Collection)

### Target Improvements
- 40% increase in daily active users
- 60% increase in session duration
- 15-20% premium conversion rate
- Smooth, professional animations throughout
- Marketplace generating revenue within 3 months

## üîß Implementation Notes

### Deployment Considerations
- Use GitHub Actions static deployment (not Jekyll)
- Absolute paths required for GitHub Pages subdirectory
- Service worker caching may need clearing for major updates
- Test favicon.png and manifest.json accessibility

### Performance Optimization
- Optimize animation frame rates
- Lazy load marketplace images
- Compress audio files for sound bath
- Minimize bundle size with tree shaking

### User Tier System
```dart
enum UserTier {
  free,      // 5 crystal limit, basic features
  premium,   // $9.99/month, unlimited crystals
  pro        // $19.99/month, marketplace priority
}
```

## üìù Development Guidelines

1. **Follow Development Plan**: Reference CRYSTAL_GRIMOIRE_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md
2. **Use Todo System**: Update TodoWrite for all major changes
3. **Maintain Mystical Theme**: Keep magical, spiritual aesthetic
4. **Test Before Deploy**: Always verify on GitHub Pages
5. **User-Centric**: Prioritize user experience over technical perfection
6. **Revenue Focus**: Marketplace and subscriptions are key monetization

## üö® Critical Notes

- **NO SHORTCUTS**: This is a production app requiring professional quality
- **Visual Appeal**: User specifically wants flashy, dynamic effects
- **Marketplace Priority**: This is the primary revenue generator
- **Collection Paywall**: Essential for subscription model
- **Mobile First**: Ensure responsive design on all devices
